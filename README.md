##  ü¶Ñ About

We implemented and tested seven different algorithms that compute new generations of Conway's Game of Life.

* **Naive:** A basic implementation.
* **Cache Optimized:** Some memory optimization to speed up access and copying.
* **Sparse Matrix Representation:** Since the rules of Conway's game tend to generate sparse universes, representing the grid as a sparse matrix allows to optimize computations.
* **Bitwise:** Stores cells as single bits to save memory for big universes.

* **Live Cell Tracker:** Keeps a record of active zones in the universe to avoid unnecessary computations.
* **Hashed Parallel:** Keeps a list of active cells as a Hash Set (with the same purpose fo only working on active areas of the grid) and parallelizes computations at each time step.

* **Hashlife:** A recursive, tree-based approach that uses memoization to speed up computation as more generations pass.

## ü¶Ñ Usage

### ‚òÅ Use `cargo run` to measure different Game of Life algorithms  ‚òÅ 

Compute a number of iterations of the Game in a toroidal grid of size $2^k$, where $k = 6 + \texttt{scale}$:

```
cargo run <scale> <iters>
```
Seven different algorithms to compute generations of the Game of Life are timed and the outputs are saved in `results_csv/test_<size>_<iters>.csv`
